Update the Charge Wealth website to position the platform as an explainable, decision-support system for high-income earners, professionals, and business owners who want clarity before making financial moves. The homepage should lead with the idea that most costly financial mistakes come from unseen second-order consequences, and that Charge Wealth exists to surface those consequences across taxes, capital allocation, and long-term planning using the user’s real data. Introduce Charge AI as the orchestration layer of the platform—a private planning engine that connects tax data, financial assumptions, and capital decisions into clear, math-backed analysis, scenario modeling, and concise planning memos that show assumptions and tradeoffs without presenting itself as personalized financial, tax, or legal advice. Present Charge Tax Intel as the core capability and primary moat of the platform, allowing users to upload their Form 1040 and related schedules to create a living tax profile that reveals income drivers, marginal versus effective tax exposure, capital gains sensitivity, carryforwards, and structural inefficiencies, and enables forward-looking what-if analysis around income changes, realizing gains, charitable giving, and retirement contributions in plain English with quantified impact. Introduce Charge Allocation as a capital allocation and opportunity engine—not a stock picking or trading platform—that helps users evaluate public equity ideas and portfolio positions through the lens of risk, valuation, concentration, timing, and tax consequences, generating AI-assisted investment theses and risk memos without buy or sell directives or performance promises. The homepage should reinforce that all insights across the platform are grounded in the user’s uploaded documents and inputs, are explainable with visible assumptions and calculations, and are designed to help users think clearly rather than transact. Maintain a premium, calm, and institutional tone that emphasizes clarity over hype, avoids generic fintech language, and clearly states that Charge Wealth provides education and decision support only, not individualized investment, tax, or legal advice. Close the page with a focused call to action to request access or join as an early member, positioning Charge Wealth as a modern planning and analysis platform for people who want to understand how their financial decisions interact before committing capital or taking action.
