Create a restructured landing page for Charge Wealth (chargewealth.co) with two versions: one for the Founding Members phase and one for post-250 regular pricing.

CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX:
- Page is too long (~8,000 words, needs to be ~2,500)
- Navigation doesn't match actual page sections
- Redundant content (two "three engines" sections, scattered CTAs)
- Tax calculator buried mid-page (should be higher)
- Founding Members section is 1,500+ words (needs to be ~300)

NAVIGATION (sticky):
Version 1 (Founding Members active): Home | Tax Calculator | How It Works | Founding Members | Take Charge | FAQ
Version 2 (Post-250): Home | Tax Calculator | How It Works | Pricing | Take Charge | FAQ

NOTE: "Take Charge" is a Beehiiv newsletter (https://takecharge.chargewealth.co) - keep this link in nav as an alternative engagement channel

PAGE STRUCTURE (both versions):

1. HERO
- Keep current: "Your AI CFO finds savings while you sleep"
- REMOVE the fake social proof (2,847 members, $9.2M saved)
- Single CTA button
- Keep the 4 trust badges (encryption, no products, built by CFPs, first alert 48hrs)

2. TAX CALCULATOR (move up from current position)
- Keep the interactive calculator exactly as is
- Place immediately after hero or after "How It Works"
- CTA after calculation changes per version

3. HOW IT WORKS (keep current 4-step section)
- "Connect accounts → AI analyzes daily → Get alerts → Execute"
- Keep current copy, this is good

4. COMPARISON TABLE (keep current)
- "Why High Earners Choose Charge Over Traditional Advisors"
- This section is strong, keep as is

5. THREE ENGINES (CONDENSE from two sections to one)
- Keep ONLY the overview section "Three Decision Engines. Zero Conflicts"
- Remove the detailed interactive examples at the bottom (fake AI chat demos)
- Each engine: icon/heading + 2-3 sentences max
- AI Advisor | Tax Advisor | Portfolio Engine

6. FOUNDING MEMBERS or PRICING (version-specific)

VERSION 1 - FOUNDING MEMBERS SECTION (~300 words total):
- Header: "Become a Founding Member"
- Subhead: "Join the first 250 members building the future"
- Counter: "187/250 spots claimed"
- Price: ~~$499~~ $279 Lifetime Access
- What's included (bullet list):
  * AI CFO monitoring 24/7
  * Unlimited AI Advisor questions
  * Full Tax Optimizer
  * Portfolio Engine
  * All future features
  * Priority support
- Founding perks (condensed to bullets only):
  * 🎯 Direct founder access via Telegram
  * 🚀 Vote on product roadmap
  * 💎 Founding member badge
  * 🔓 Lifetime feature unlocks
- Why only 250: "We're limiting to 250 so we can personally respond to feedback and ensure white-glove treatment. Once we hit 250, price increases to $499 and founder perks close forever."
- Single CTA: "Join as Founding Member — $279"
- 30-day money back guarantee

REMOVE from Founding Members:
- All testimonials
- "What we expect from founding members" section
- "Built for you if / Not for you if" section  
- Detailed perks explanations
- "Founding Members Are Already Saving" section

VERSION 2 - PRICING SECTION (replaces Founding Members after 250):
Use the current pricing table:
- Monthly: $49/mo
- 3 Months: $99 ($33/mo, save 33%)
- 6 Months: $200 ($33/mo, best value)
- Lifetime: $499 (one payment, forever access)
- Feature list (bullets):
  * Unlimited AI Advisor questions
  * Proactive insights delivered without asking
  * Full Tax Advisor with 10+ strategies
  * Portfolio Engine with specific recommendations
  * All future updates included
- Note above pricing: "Founding member pricing ($279) ended at member #250"
- CTA on each plan card
- 30-day money back guarantee

7. FAQ (keep current section exactly as is)

8. FOOTER (keep current)
- Keep "Take Charge" newsletter link in footer as well
- Keep all blog links

SECTIONS TO COMPLETELY REMOVE:
- The second "three engines" section at bottom with interactive fake chat examples
- All founding member testimonials
- "What we expect from founding members"
- "Built for you if / Not for you if"
- Any redundant CTAs not in main sections
- Social proof numbers from hero (2,847 members saving $9.2M)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Smooth scroll to anchor links in navigation (except "Take Charge" which is external link)
- Sticky navigation bar
- Keep all current styling/design
- Maintain mobile responsiveness
- Add a simple toggle/feature flag to switch between Version 1 and Version 2
