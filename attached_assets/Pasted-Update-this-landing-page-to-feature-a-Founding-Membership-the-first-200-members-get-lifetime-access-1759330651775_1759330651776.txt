Update this landing page to feature a Founding Membership: the first 200 members get lifetime access for a one-time fee of $378, after which new members pay $78/month. Keep the institutional look and current palette. In the hero, use the headline “Plan Like the Wealthy. Without the $10M Net Worth.” and the subline “Exclusive strategies normally reserved for family offices — simplified and delivered through your private Command Dashboard.” Set the primary CTA to “Claim Founding Membership.” Immediately below the hero, add an Offer block titled “Founding Membership: Limited to 200,” with bullets: “One-time $378 for lifetime access (first 200 only),” “After 200 members → $78/month,” and “Most advisors charge $2,000+/year; Charge Wealth delivers family-office playbooks at a fraction of that.” Include a gold accent CTA “Secure My Lifetime Access.” Add a Command Dashboard section with headline “Your Command Dashboard” and bullets: “Wealth Playbooks — CFP-vetted strategies delivered monthly,” “Unlimited Tools — tax optimizers, estate flowcharts, allocation calculators,” “Always-On Access — no calls, no meetings, 24/7 control,” plus a CTA “Unlock My Dashboard.” Refresh the Why section bullets to: “Backed by CFPs with over a decade of experience,” “One-time founding rate — $378 for life (200 spots only),” “Ongoing members pay $78/month — still far less than advisory retainers,” “Your own Command Dashboard — institutional tools, zero gatekeepers.” Above the signup form, add urgency microcopy: “⚡ Only 200 lifetime spots available — secure yours before it’s gone.” In the FAQ, keep the first four items and add: “What’s the $378 lifetime offer? → The first 200 members get unlimited, lifetime access for a single payment. After that, new members pay $78/month.” Update the email form name to charge-wealth-waitlist and keep fields (Email, Income Band, Primary Goal). Ensure all CTAs point to the signup anchor for now (pre-payment), and place TODO comments where we will later swap the form for a checkout flow (Stripe: “Founding Lifetime $378” and “Monthly $78”). Keep the compliance disclaimer above the footer: “Education-Only Disclaimer: Charge Wealth provides general educational information and tools. We do not provide individualized investment, legal, or tax advice, and we do not recommend specific securities. Consult your own advisor/CPA/attorney before taking action.” Update the <title> to “Charge Wealth • Founding Membership $378 for Life (First 200)” and meta description to “First 200 get lifetime access for a one-time $378. After that, $78/month. CFP-vetted family-office playbooks with a private Command Dashboard.” Leave placeholders for Meta/TikTok pixels in <head>.
