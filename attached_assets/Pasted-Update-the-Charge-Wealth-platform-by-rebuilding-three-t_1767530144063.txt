Update the Charge Wealth platform by rebuilding three tightly integrated intelligence products that operate off a shared user financial profile. First, create Charge AI, a private planning engine designed to function as a decision-support CFO, not a generic chatbot. Charge AI must only reason from the user’s uploaded documents, tax data, financial assumptions, and saved scenarios, and it should explain conclusions using clear math, assumptions, and tradeoffs. It should proactively identify second-order consequences of financial decisions (tax impact, liquidity stress, concentration risk, timing risk) and generate concise planning memos users can save. Second, create Charge Tax Intel, a tax intelligence engine that allows users to upload their Form 1040 and related schedules, automatically extracting and normalizing the data into a living tax profile. Charge Tax Intel should highlight income concentration, marginal vs effective tax exposure, capital gains sensitivity, AMT indicators, carryforwards, and structural inefficiencies, then allow users to run forward-looking “what-if” scenarios such as realizing gains, charitable giving, retirement contributions, or income changes. Third, create Charge Allocation, a capital allocation and opportunity engine that analyzes public equities through the lens of risk, valuation, concentration, and tax consequences rather than stock picking or trade recommendations. Charge Allocation should help users understand how individual positions fit into their broader financial picture, identify concentration or timing risks, compare alternative deployment paths for capital, and generate AI-assisted investment theses and risk memos without issuing buy or sell directives. All three products must share context continuously so that insights from taxes inform investment decisions, investment changes inform planning outcomes, and Charge AI acts as the orchestration layer that connects insights across the platform into coherent, explainable guidance focused on better decisions rather than transactions.
