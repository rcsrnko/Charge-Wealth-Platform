Update the Tax Intel module to focus specifically on W-2/paycheck optimization. 

## Changes needed:

### 1. Simplify the upload flow
- Default document type to "paystub" (most common use case)
- After upload, immediately show actionable recommendations
- Remove scenarios and complex analysis for now

### 2. Replace the AI analysis prompt in /api/tax-intel/analyze

Use this focused prompt for W-2 and paystub analysis:

"""
You are a paycheck optimization specialist. The user uploaded their W-2 or paystub. Your ONLY job: help them keep more of each paycheck.

DOCUMENT TYPE: ${docType}
USER STATE: ${userContext.state}
FILING STATUS: ${userContext.filing}

From their document, identify:
1. Current withholding (federal, state, FICA)
2. Pre-tax deductions they're using (401k, HSA, FSA, etc.)
3. Pre-tax deductions they're NOT using but could

}

RULES:
- Only suggest legal, common optimizations
- Be specific with dollar amounts
- Give exact steps to implement each fix
- Prioritize by impact (biggest savings first)
- If they're already maxing everything, say so
"""

### 3. Update the UI
- Show results as a simple checklist: "Do this → Save $X/year"
- Add a "total savings" number prominently at top
- Each optimization should have a "How to fix" expandable section

### 4. Simplify document types
- Only show W-2 and Paystub as upload options for now
- Hide 1040 and 1099 options (we'll add those later)

Keep all existing database storage and document parsing logic. Just update the prompts and UI to focus on actionable paycheck optimization.
