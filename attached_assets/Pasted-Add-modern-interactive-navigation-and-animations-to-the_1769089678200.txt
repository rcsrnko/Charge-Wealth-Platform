Add modern interactive navigation and animations to the Charge Wealth landing page to make it feel more engaging and app-like.

INSTALL DEPENDENCIES:
- framer-motion (for animations)
- react-intersection-observer (for scroll detection)

TIER 1 ANIMATIONS (Must Have):

1. SCROLL-TRIGGERED FADE-INS
- Each major section fades up as user scrolls to it
- Use Framer Motion's viewport detection
- Stagger child elements (fade in sequentially, not all at once)
- Sections to animate: Hero, Tax Calculator, How It Works, Comparison Table, Three Engines, Founding Members/Pricing, FAQ
- Animation: opacity 0→1, translateY 50px→0, duration 0.6s, ease out
- Trigger when section is 20% in viewport

2. ACTIVE NAVIGATION HIGHLIGHTING  
- Use Intersection Observer to detect which section is currently in view
- Highlight the corresponding nav item (underline, color change, or background)
- Smooth transition between active states
- Should work for: Tax Calculator, How It Works, Founding Members/Pricing, FAQ sections

3. SMOOTH SCROLL BEHAVIOR
- Clicking nav items smoothly scrolls to section (not instant jump)
- Add offset for sticky nav (don't hide section header behind nav bar)
- Duration: 800ms with ease-in-out
- Native CSS smooth scroll as fallback

TIER 2 ANIMATIONS (High Impact):

4. TAX CALCULATOR LIVE ANIMATIONS
- When sliders move, numbers count up/down smoothly (not instant jump)
- Total savings number has emphasis animation when it updates (scale pulse)
- Use counting animation library or custom hook
- Duration: 400ms for smooth feel

5. STICKY CTA BAR (appears after scrolling past hero)
- After user scrolls past hero section, sticky bar appears at bottom
- Contains: "Join Founding Members — $279 | Only 63 Spots Left" + CTA button
- Slides up from bottom with smooth animation
- Disappears when user scrolls back to top
- Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- Should not block content on mobile

6. MAGNETIC CTA BUTTONS
- Primary CTA buttons slightly follow cursor on hover
- Subtle effect (max 10px movement)
- Only on desktop (disable on mobile/touch devices)
- Apply to: Main hero CTA, Founding Members CTA, pricing card CTAs
- Smooth spring animation with Framer Motion

TIER 3 ANIMATIONS (Nice to Have):

7. NUMBER COUNTER ANIMATIONS
- If keeping any statistics, animate them counting up when section appears
- Example: "187/250 spots claimed" counts from 0→187
- Only animate once per page load (not on every scroll)
- Pause animation if user scrolls away before complete

8. HOVER STATE ENHANCEMENTS
- Three Engines cards: subtle lift + shadow on hover
- Pricing cards: scale 1.02 + glow effect on hover
- FAQ items: smooth expand/collapse with height animation
- Navigation links: underline slide-in effect on hover

9. SCROLL PROGRESS INDICATOR
- Thin line at very top of page showing scroll progress (0-100%)
- Fixed position, z-index above everything
- Color matches brand (gradient preferred)
- 2-3px height
- Updates smoothly as user scrolls
