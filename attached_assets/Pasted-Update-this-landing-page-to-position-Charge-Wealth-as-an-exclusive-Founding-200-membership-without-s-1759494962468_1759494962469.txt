Update this landing page to position Charge Wealth as an exclusive Founding 200 membership without showing any pricing. Replace all references to Charge Finance with Charge Wealth. Keep the existing institutional style and palette (Slate Navy #0E2239, Charcoal #1C1F24, Off-White #F7F7F5, Gold #C9A86A). In the hero, use the headline “Plan Like the Wealthy. Without the $10M Net Worth.” and the subline “Exclusive family-office playbooks and private tools — simplified and delivered through your Command Dashboard.” Update the CTA buttons to say “Join the Founding Waitlist.” Add a new section immediately under the hero called Founding 200 Membership with a headline “Limited to 200 Founders” and body copy that says: “We are opening the doors to just 200 Founding Members. Founders will unlock lifetime perks, insider strategies, and priority access to our private Command Dashboard. After these 200 spots are filled, membership moves into a premium subscription tier.” Include a strong CTA button labeled “Reserve My Founding Spot.” Add a section titled Your Command Dashboard that explains: “Exclusive access to your private Command Dashboard: Wealth Playbooks, tax and estate tools, and 24/7 control without advisors standing in the way.” Use three feature bullets here: “CFP-vetted Wealth Playbooks delivered monthly,” “Unlimited insider tools: tax optimizers, estate flowcharts, allocation calculators,” and “Always-on access with no meetings or gatekeepers.” Refresh the “Why” section to list: “Backed by CFPs with over a decade of experience,” “Limited to the first 200 Founders,” “Insider playbooks family offices don’t advertise,” and “Your own Command Dashboard — institutional tools made accessible.” Above the signup form, add urgency microcopy: “⚡ Over 1,000 people already on the list. Don’t miss the Founding 200.” Keep the form named charge-wealth-waitlist, with fields for Email, Income Band, and Primary Goal. Ensure the CTA button under the form reads “Join the Founding Waitlist.” Update the success message to: “You’re in! We’ll email your Founding 200 invite soon. ⚡” Keep the compliance disclaimer in the footer: “Education-Only Disclaimer: Charge Wealth provides general educational information and tools. We do not provide individualized investment, legal, or tax advice, and we do not recommend specific securities. Consult your own advisor/CPA/attorney before taking action.” Update the page title to “Charge Wealth • Founding 200 Membership” and meta description to: “Join the exclusive Founding 200 waitlist. CFP-vetted family-office strategies and private Command Dashboard access. Limited to 200 members.” Leave TODO comments for Meta and TikTok Pixel placement.
