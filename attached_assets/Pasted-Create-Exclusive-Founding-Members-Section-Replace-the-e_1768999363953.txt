Why We're Doing This Section
Heading: "Why Only 250?"
Paragraph:
"We're limiting founding memberships because we want to build this the right way—with deep engagement from our early community. At 250 members, we can personally respond to feedback, host meaningful strategy sessions, and ensure every founding member gets white-glove treatment. Once we hit 250, the price increases to $499 and founder perks close forever."

Founding Member Commitment Section
Heading: "What We Expect From Founding Members"
Paragraph:
"This isn't a passive membership. We're looking for engaged members who will:"

FAQ Items to Add (Specific to Founding Members)
Q: What happens after 250 founding members?
A: The founding member program closes permanently. New members will pay $499 for lifetime access but won't get founder perks like Telegram access, voting rights, quarterly sessions, or the founding member badge. You can't buy these perks later—they're exclusive to the first 250.
Q: How active is the Telegram channel?
A: Very. Our founding team posts daily updates, responds to questions within hours, and shares market insights as they happen. Current members are active too—you'll get peer advice from other high earners, not just our team. Think of it as a private financial strategy group.
Q: Can I really influence what features get built?
A: Absolutely. We run monthly polls where founding members vote on the roadmap. Top 3 features get built first. Recent example: Mobile push notifications won the December vote, so that's in development now. Your vote carries real weight.
Q: What if I don't want to be in the Telegram or participate?
A: That's fine, but honestly, you should just wait for the public launch at $499. Founding membership is designed for engaged members who want to be part of the process. If you just want the software, it'll still be great at $499—but you'll miss the community and input opportunities.
Q: How long do I have to decide?
A: Until we hit 250 members. We're currently at 187/250. At our current pace, that's about 2-3 weeks. Once we hit 250, founding member perks close forever and the price increases. Don't wait.
Q: Is the $279 price really lifetime?
A: Yes. One payment, lifetime access to everything. No subscriptions, no renewals, no surprise charges. Even when we launch new premium features or raise prices to $499+, you're locked in forever. We honor founding member pricing for life.

Design Notes for Replit Agent:

Make the "LIMITED TO 250 MEMBERS" badge prominent and eye-catching (bright color, maybe pulsing animation)
The progress indicator "187/250 spots claimed" should update dynamically (you'll need to implement counter logic)
Use a two-column layout for "What Founding Members Get" on desktop, stack on mobile
Founding member exclusive perks should visually stand out (different background color, icons, or border)
The urgency box before final CTA should be visually distinct (colored background, maybe red/orange accent)
Social proof mini-grid should be compact cards, not full testimonials
Add subtle animations to the CTA button (hover effect, maybe a slight pulse)


Scarcity/Urgency Elements to Emphasize:

The "187/250" counter (make it prominent)
"Only 63 remaining" language
"Closes permanently" messaging
"Price increases to $499" contrast
Timeline urgency: "2-3 weeks at current pace"


Tone Guidelines:

Exclusive but not elitist
Collaborative ("building together") not transactional
Honest about expectations (you need to participate)
Emphasize value of community + input, not just software
Make it clear these perks can NEVER be purchased later
Use social proof from existing founding members
Create FOMO but don't be manipulative


Implementation Checklist:

 Remove old testimonials section completely
 Add new Founding Members section after three engines
 Implement progress counter (187/250) with dynamic updates
 Add Telegram/founder access descriptions
 Include voting/roadmap influence details
 Create mini social proof grid (5 cards)
 Update all pricing mentions to include "Founding Member" context
 Add 4 new FAQ items about founding program
 Ensure CTA button links to correct signup with founding member flag
 Add urgency elements (counter, timeline, closing language)
 Style founding member badge/perks distinctly from regular features
 Test on mobile (two columns should stack properly)


BONUS: Update Pricing Section CTA
Also update the main pricing section to reference founding members:
Change the pricing badge from "EARLY ACCESS OFFER" to:
"FOUNDING MEMBER PROGRAM — 63 SPOTS LEFT"
Add text above the $279 price:
"Lock in founding member benefits before we hit 250 members and close this program forever"
This creates consistency between the dedicated founding members section and the pricing section.
