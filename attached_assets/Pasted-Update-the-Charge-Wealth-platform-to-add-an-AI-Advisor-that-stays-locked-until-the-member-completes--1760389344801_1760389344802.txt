Update the Charge Wealth platform to add an AI Advisor that stays locked until the member completes a minimum profile threshold, then unlocks in a gamified way. Create a new left-nav item “AI Advisor” that shows a locked state by default with a progress ring and checklist that pulls completeness from existing modules (Net Worth snapshot saved, Liquidity Guardrail set, Allocation target chosen, 3+ items saved in Tax Strategy Lab; weight each to compute a percentage). Display a progress bar, “X% to unlock,” and actionable buttons that deep-link to the missing steps; once the user reaches 70%+, fire a subtle confetti animation and change the nav badge to “Unlocked.” The unlocked AI Advisor should be a clean chat UI pane with: (1) a fixed header disclaimer “Education-Only. Not individualized financial, tax, or legal advice”; (2) starter chips like “Optimize my allocation,” “Am I over/under my liquidity guardrail?”, “Tax plays that fit my profile,” “Retirement timeline sanity check”; (3) the model’s system prompt set to a CFP-vetted, compliance-safe persona (“Charge Wealth Guide”) that references read-only context from the member’s data (latest Net Worth, Liquidity target vs current, Allocation mix and risk score, saved Tax Playbook items), uses plain English, cites which module each suggestion came from, and always includes a gentle consult-a-pro reminder for decisions; (4) safety rails to avoid product recommendations, securities picks, or projections presented as guarantees. Add a small “session notes” drawer that auto-captures a 3-bullet summary after every 5 messages with a Save to My Playbook toggle; include thumbs up/down feedback per response and an Export Summary button that downloads a plaintext brief. If locked, show a “Preview Questions” mode with read-only example answers blurred and a tooltip “Unlock by completing your setup (70%).” Keep all styling consistent with the modern palette and icons, use a celebratory micro-interaction on unlock, persist lock/unlock state with the rest of the platform, and ensure mobile responsiveness and accessibility.
